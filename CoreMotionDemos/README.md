# CoreMotion Demos

This sample code and [the related talk](https://github.com/mattblair/CoreMotionDemos/blob/master/CoreMotion-CocoaHeads150225.pdf) are based on code from [Peripatetic](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/peripatetic/id966697947?mt=8), which is now available in the App Store.

This project contains demos of some of the Core Motion APIs available in iOS 8 which I created for a talk at PDX CocoaHeads:

* Real-time Motion Activity (this was introduced in iOS 7, but the `bicycling` property is new)
* Real-time pedometer 
* Historical pedometer
* Altimeter
* CLFloor (which is CoreLocation, but I added it here so I can check for defined floors while I'm wandering the world)

Some features will work on an iPhone 5s, but running the app on an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus is the best option. It won't do much on a simulator.
